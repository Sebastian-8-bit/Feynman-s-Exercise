# Feynman-s-Exercise

These are my work on the exercises from the Feynman's Lecture on Physics.

All the figures in the pdf file is redrawn using Mathcha.
The pdf files is exported directly from Obsidian.

I'm not a native English speaker, so there might be some grammar error or words used incorrectly.
I hope the core idea of dealing with the exercises is clear enough for other people who also want to learn FLP to understand.
